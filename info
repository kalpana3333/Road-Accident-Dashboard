ðŸš€ Hey Community, I am excited to share my new project on Road Accident Dashboard Analysis using MS-Excel

Objectives:
Monitor Road Safety: Track and analyze road accident statistics to identify trends and areas needing improvement.
Reduce Casualties: Use the data to implement measures aimed at reducing the number of fatalities and serious injuries on the roads.
Identify High-Risk Areas: Determine which types of roads and conditions contribute most to accidents to focus safety efforts.
Improve Policy Making: Provide insights for policymakers to develop targeted interventions for road safety.


Key Points:
Casualty Overview:
Total casualties: 417,883
Fatal casualties: 7,135 (1.7%)
Serious casualties: 59,312 (14.2%)
Slight casualties: 351,436 (84.1%)
Car casualties: 33,348 (79.8%)
Casualties by Vehicle Type:
Cars: 12,798
Trucks: 33,472
Buses: 12,798
Bicycles: 33,672
Tractors: 1,032
Others: 3,424
Casualties by Road Type:
Single carriageway: 309.7K
Dual carriageway: 67.4K
Roundabout: 26.8K
One-way street: 7.4K
Slip road: 4.7K
Casualties by Location:
Urban: 255.9K
Rural: 162.0K
Casualties by Light Condition:
Daylight: 305.0K
Dark: 112.9K
Casualties by Road Surface:
Dry: 279,445
Wet: 115,261
Snow/Ice: 23,177
Monthly Trend Comparison:
Consistent casualties throughout the year with slight fluctuations between 2021 and 2022.



Conclusions:
High-Risk Conditions: Single carriageways and urban areas are the most common settings for accidents, highlighting areas for potential safety improvements.
Vehicle Types: Cars and trucks are involved in the majority of accidents, suggesting a focus on these vehicles could be beneficial.
Time of Day: A higher number of accidents occur during daylight, possibly due to higher traffic volumes during these times.
Surface Conditions: Dry road conditions see the most accidents, which may indicate that factors other than weather (like traffic density and driving behavior) are significant contributors to accidents.
Seasonal Trends: Casualty numbers remain relatively stable throughout the year, indicating a persistent need for continuous road safety measures.
These insights can guide targeted interventions to reduce accidents, improve road safety, and allocate resources effectively.
